			Geralt is a witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long
			training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a
			merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the
			multifarious monsters and vile fiends that ravage the land and attack
			the innocent. He roams the country seeking assignments, but
			gradually comes to realise that while some of his quarry are
			unremittingly vile, vicious grotesques, others are the victims of sin, evil
			or simple naivety.
